# Intermediate Python Project: Netflix 1990s Movie Analysis

Welcome to my project repository!

This project was created as part of the **Intermediate Python** course on DataCamp. It applies various Python concepts in a real-world context by analyzing Netflix movie data from the 1990s.

## 📁 Project Files

* `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis
* `netflix_data.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis
* `redpopcorn.jpg`: Image used for visualization/illustration (optional)

## 📌 Key Concepts Applied

* Data cleaning and preprocessing using **pandas**
* Filtering and manipulating DataFrames
* Numerical operations with **NumPy**
* Data visualization using **matplotlib**
* Conditional logic, loops, and functions
* A real-world case study using hacker statistics

## 🎯 Project Summary

The project focuses on Netflix movies released in the **1990s**:

* Identified the most frequent movie duration
* Filtered and counted short action movies (less than 90 minutes)
* Explored movie genres, directors, and runtime distributions

## 🚀 Outcome

By completing this project, I:

* Strengthened my practical understanding of Python for data analysis
* Learned how to structure, explore, and visualize real datasets
* Applied core skills in a relevant and industry-based context
